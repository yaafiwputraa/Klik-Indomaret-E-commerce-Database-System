# Klik Indomaret - SQL Database Modeling & Analysis

This project is a university-level database modeling and SQL analysis case study based on a simulated e-commerce platform, **Klik Indomaret**, developed for the Database Modeling course at Institut Teknologi Bandung.

## 📌 Project Overview

Klik Indomaret simulates an online retail platform for daily consumer products. The goal of this project is to design a normalized relational database, implement an ER model, and perform SQL queries to extract business-relevant insights such as customer activity, product performance, and operational metrics.

## 🧱 Database Design

- Fully normalized relational schema (up to BCNF)
- Covers 13+ interrelated entities such as `User`, `Product`, `Order`, `Transaction`, `Courier`, `Review`, `Voucher`, etc.
- Built using relational modeling techniques including:
  - ER Diagram design
  - Mapping specialization/generalization and multivalued attributes
  - Foreign key relationships

## 📊 SQL Querying & Insights

A series of analytical SQL queries were written to simulate real-world data needs, such as:

- Top categories with highest product sales in the last year
- Most efficient couriers based on delivery volume
- Products with high ratings and their suppliers
- Customers with the highest number of transactions and their average ratings
- Voucher expiration and discount monitoring

All queries are located in the `Milestone3` document.
